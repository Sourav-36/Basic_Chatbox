# Basic_Chatbox
Made a simple interacting Chatbox using python, using the implementations of GUI and socket programming in python.
Made 2 different python files named server1.py and client1.py, where I first connected them.
Then the GUI of both the server and client dialog boxes will open.
And then what will happen is the continuous sending and receiving of messages from the client side and server side
